# Description

This project is a simple work day planner that lets users enter in tasks for different times of the workday. Users are also able to save the tasks they entered in local storage so that they may view the tasks later. The planner also will color code the tasks for the user, letting them know if the time slot is in the past, incipient, or in the future.
